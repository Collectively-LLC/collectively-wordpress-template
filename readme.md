# Documentation for <Client>
Full project documentation for kennedybrotherspt.com, the main website for <CLIENT>.  It was built using the [Roots ecosystem](http://roots.io), which consists of the Trellis server environment automation, the Bedrock WordPress boilderplate, and the Sage starter theme.

# Getting Started
Development and deployment rely on Trellis, a close emulation of the server environment

## System Prerequisites
- PHP >= 5.6
- Composer
- Virtualbox >= 4.3.10
- Vagrant >= 2.0.1

## Installing
Every Collectively WordPress project sits on the Trellis-Bedrock-Sage-Themans stack.
- **Trellis**: Local development envitonment via Vagrant and VirtualBox
- **Bedrock**: 12-Factor WordPress stack with built in development tools
- **Sage**: Roots-based WordPress starter theme
- **Themans**: Collectively-built starter theme that extends Sage
- **Digital Ocean**: Collectively's recommended production server environment

### Installing Trellis
Configure your WordPress sites in `group_vars/development/wordpress_sites.yml` and in `group_vars/development/vault.yml`

### Installing Bedrock

### Installing Sage

### Installing Themans
To install Themeans, clone the entire repo into your development directory, ie: /themeans.test

```
git clone --depth=1 git@github.com:Collectively-LLC/themeans.git
```

Update your site hosts in `/trellis/group_vars/development/wordpress_sites.yml` and `/trellis/group_vars/development/vault.yml`

Update your `publicPath` and `devUrl` in `/site/web/app/themes/themeans/resources/assets/config.json`

Change your theme details (title, author, etc.) in `/site/web/app/themes/themeans/resources/style.css`

Spin up your local dev VM by running `vagrant up` from the `/trellis` folder

To initialize your theme, navigate to your theme's directory (`/site/web/app/themes/themeans`) and run `yarn && yarn build`

You can then activate BrowserSync from the theme directory using `yarn run start`

### Provisioning Server
For remote servers, installing Ansible locally is an additional requirement. See the docs for more information.

A base Ubuntu 16.04 server is required for setting up remote servers. OS X users must have passlib installed.

1. Configure your WordPress sites in `group_vars/<environment>/wordpress_sites.yml` and in `group_vars/<environment>/vault.yml` (see the Vault docs for how to encrypt files containing passwords)
2. Add your server IP/hostnames to `hosts/<environment>`
3. Specify public SSH keys for users in `group_vars/all/users.yml` (see the SSH Keys docs)
4. Run `ansible-playbook server.yml -e env=<environment>` to provision the server

Read the [Treliis remote server docs](https://roots.io/trellis/docs/deploys/) for more information.




# Running the Tests

# Development
Developing the application requires running a virtual environment on your local machine.

## 1. Start Trellis
`cd trellis/`
`vagrant up`

Read the [Trellis local development docs](https://roots.io/trellis/docs/local-development-setup/) for more information.

## WIP - Section Below
Themeans is a custom variant of Sage, and, as such, there are certain organizational methods which are atypical to a traditional WordPress theme. This may feel like chaos, but it's for the best. ðŸ˜…

#### Components
Theme: site/web/app/themes/themeans
Most of your front-end development will happen in site/web/app/themes/themeans/resources
template files / Æ¬ÌµÌ¬ÌŠ "root" : site/web/app/themes/themeans/views - index., page., search., single., etc. template files, as would typically be found in the root of a WordPress theme folder
partial layouts : site/web/app/themes/views/themeans/views/partials - layout components, ie: header, footer, sidebar, comments
theme assets : site/web/app/themes/views/themeans/assets - contains folders for images, styles, scripts, etc.
Composer Plugins json: site/composer.json - contains a standard set of plugins that are applicable to most WordPress sites
can be modified to add additional plugins
removal of existing plugins is not recommended, though they can be deactivated via the wp-admin
MU-Plugin: site/web/app/mu-plugins/themeans-functions
Themeans global helper functions, Meta boxes, and Options pages
Don't touch pls
Custom MU-Plugin: site/web/app/mu-plugins/your-site-name
your site-specific CPTs, Meta configurations, Options pages, filters, and anything surrounding data will live here
a few prebuilt functions are included by default to help get you started; some of these may work for you out of the box, others will require fitting to your theme and use, and few may be unnecessary to your theme entirely - modify this entirely to fit your needs
Why an MU-Plugin? Why TWO MU-Plugins?
Keeping data-handling functionality independent of the theme itself will help to mitigate the effects on the site content in the event of theme replacement or disruption. For example, if a site were to fall-back to the WordPress Twentyseventeen Theme, or the client were to want a new WordPress theme entirely, the existing data architecture and access points, and thus, any content depending on it, would be preserved.

It is possible that functions developed in your custom mu-plugin are not dependent on the Themeans-functions mu-plugin or on other libraries, but it is perfectly acceptible if they are.

The Themeans-functions mu-plugin itself is dependant on external plugins. When using the full Themeans environment, plugins are installed via the composer.json file. In any case, you will receive alerts in the wp-admin if any required components are not located / active.

#### Using Sage 9
Passing Data from Custom Plugin to the Theme
If you're developing functionality to generate information needed to be accessible in all areas of the site, you can use the Sage 9 global filter:

add_action('the_post', function() {
    sage('blade')->share('links', [
        'facebook' => 'https://facebook.com/rootswp',
        'twitter' => 'https://twitter.com/rootswp'
    ]);
});
From within any Blade template, use {{ $links['facebook'] }} and {{ $links['twitter'] }} to output the data.

If your data output is template- or page-specific, you can use:

add_filter('sage/template/page/data', function (array $data) {
    $data['header_image'] = get_field('header_image');
    $data['header_content'] = get_field('header_content');
    return $data;
});
In your Blade templates for pages, use {{ $header_image }} and {{ $header_content }} to output the data.

Referencing your front-end assets
@asset('images/stella.jpg') will expand to http://example.dev/app/themes/sage/dist/images/stella_264f29a6.jpg

Getting Blade templates via PHP
add_shortcode('reviews', function($atts) {
    return \App\template('partials.reviews');
});

# Deployment
1. Add the repo (Git URL) of your Bedrock WordPress project in the corresponding group_vars/<environment>/wordpress_sites.yml file
2. Set the branch you want to deploy
3. Run ./bin/deploy.sh <environment> <site name>
4. To rollback a deploy, run ansible-playbook rollback.yml -e "site=<site name> env=<environment>"
